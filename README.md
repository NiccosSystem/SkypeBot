A recode of my SkypeBot.

This recode includes plugin functionality, where plugins can listen to different hooks. It also has a easy-to-use command system.

Some chunks of code (Most notably in the Plugin department) are similar - if not sometimes equal - to CanaryRecode's code. So some credits go to them. The Hook part is not lent from CanaryRecode, I just chose that word because I think it sounds better than words such as "event" etc.


IMPORTANT:
This project uses Visual Illusions Entertainment's (Darkdiplomat) VIUtils. The project's GitHub is https://github.com/Visual-Illusions/viutils
A LOT of thanks go to them for making stuff easier for me :-)
