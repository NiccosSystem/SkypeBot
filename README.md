A recode of my SkypeBot.

This recode includes plugin functionality, where plugins can listen to different hooks. It also has a easy-to-use command system.

IMPORTANT:
This project uses Visual Illusions Entertainment's (Darkdiplomat) VIUtils. The project's GitHub is https://github.com/Visual-Illusions/viutils
A LOT of thanks go to them for making stuff easier for me :-)
